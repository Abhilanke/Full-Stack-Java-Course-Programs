package basicPrograms;

//Java features
//1.class based
//2.object oriented
//3.high level
//
//4.compiled => javac and interpreted/JVM => java
//                  compiler             interpreter/JVM
//source code(.java) => byte code(.class) => machine/native code(.exe)
//
//****JVM(Java Virtual Machine)
//- virtual bcz,it doesn't exists physically
//-converts byte code(.class) into machine/native code(.exe)
// - abstract/hidden machine
//-JVM-> platform depdendent
//JVM is designed using c and cpp, and c and cpp are the platform dependent languages
//that's why JVM is also platform dependent
//
//- JVM is heart of the java programming
//-for diff OS we need to install diff JVM 
//
//
//5.java=>Platform(OS+processor) independent language
//=> that java's byte code is platform independent bcz, we can crete that byte code on one platform and execute it on any other platforms without making any changes into that code
//WORA(Write Once Run Anywhere)
//windows
//Linux
//mac
//
//*** JVM, ,JSDK,JRE
//
//JSDK(Java Standard DEVELOPMENT/code Kit)  => consists of tools which are used to DEVELOP an application
//
//JRE (Java RUNTIME Environment)  => consists of tools which are used to RUN an application e.g javac, java/JVM

//6.Simple 
//pointer=>  c,in c operator overloding => cpp has been removed from java
//java follows simple and easy syntex of c

//7.Secure
//1.because java doesn't consists of concept of pointer.
//2.and consists of concept of encapsulation thats way java is secure

//8.Portable 
//we can create bytecode in one platform and we can carry/execute on any other platform

//9.multithreaded

//10.distrinuted

//11.architectural neutral


//*****TYPE OF SOFTWERE/APPLICATION?****


//1.windows based => console/offline e.g paint,msoffice

//2.Web based => runs on browser/online e.g Ecommerce-website

//3.Standalone => developed for specific systems e.g software at medical/grocery shop

//4.distributed=> Which is distrubuted all over the n/w 

//5.Gamming application
